# Non-permissible Mobile Detection to Enhance Security in Bangladeshi Museum: A Multiprocess YOLO-Based Approach

The museum's main goal regarding security is to develop an automatic smartphone detection system that will generate an alarm message if a visitor tries to use a mobile phone or take pictures with it. For detecting human faces, the system has used a built-in yolov8 data set with the help of yolov8n-face.pt model for human face detection. The system can also store the face data into a storage device for security and identification purposes. The system captures video at n frames per second by the CCTV in the museum and the corresponding frames are extracted in time sequence and the frames are sent to the automatic smartphone detection system which is depicted in Figure 1.
